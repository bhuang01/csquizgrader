Main Problems:
  What libraries should we use?
  
Structure of our project:
  Step 1: Convert to text file
      -Use smart indent
  Step 2: Run file in java 
      -smart indent
  Step 3: Convert the person's code into a java file
  
  Step 4: Run the java file with sample input and output
  
  Step 5: Analyze their code. Make a text file that has comments for each part of the code. 
      Ex. (if there's an error, return the error statement. if it works return works!)
      
  Step 6: store number of problems correct and number wrong to determine final grade.
  
 
 
 
 
Extensions:
    1. Make grading smarter by giving the partial credit for completing the most important parts of the code. 
    Also if there's small syntax errors such as missing a semicolon it shouldn't count.
